1. Drop/delete all of the tables/views you will be creating below.

	DROP TABLE dogs;
	DROP TABLE visits;
	DROP VIEW dog_visits;

2. Create a table dogs with a dog id, a breed and a name. Dog id should
	be on an auto-incremenet primary key.
	
	CREATE TABLE dogs(
	dog_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	breed VARCHAR(30),
	name VARCHAR(30)
	);
	
3. Put at least 5 records in this table.

	INSERT INTO dogs(breed, name) VALUES('bulldog', 'allen');
	INSERT INTO dogs(breed, name) VALUES('beagle', 'craig');
	INSERT INTO dogs(breed, name) VALUES('poodle', 'edna');
	INSERT INTO dogs(breed, name) VALUES('pug', 'lucy');
	INSERT INTO dogs(breed, name) VALUES('chihuahua', 'eugene');

4. Do a select * on this table to show all the records

	SELECT * FROM dogs;

5. Create a table called visits with a visit id (autoincrement primary 
	key), dog id (foreign key into dogs) and date. Use the CURDATE() 
	function.
	
	CREATE TABLE visits(
	visit_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	dog_id INT,
	date DATE,
	PRIMARY KEY(visit_id),
	FOREIGN KEY(dog_id) REFERENCES dogs(dog_id)
	);

6. Put at least 8 records in this table, which will mean some of the 
	dogs will have multiple visits.
	
	INSERT INTO visits(dog_id, date) VALUES(1, CURDATE());
	INSERT INTO visits(dog_id, date) VALUES(2, CURDATE());
	INSERT INTO visits(dog_id, date) VALUES(3, CURDATE());
	INSERT INTO visits(dog_id, date) VALUES(4, CURDATE());
	INSERT INTO visits(dog_id, date) VALUES(5, CURDATE());
	INSERT INTO visits(dog_id, date) VALUES(2, CURDATE());
	INSERT INTO visits(dog_id, date) VALUES(3, CURDATE());
	INSERT INTO visits(dog_id, date) VALUES(1, CURDATE());

7. Do a select * on this table to show all the records

	SELECT * FROM visits;

8. Add a column to the visit table for the time or day of week â€“ there 
	are many date/time functions, pick one to use.
	
	ALTER TABLE visits ADD time TIME;

9. Update several rows to add values to the column you just created.

	UPDATE visits SET time = '10:10:10 AM' WHERE visit_id = 4;
	UPDATE visits SET time = '11:11:11 AM' WHERE visit_id = 5;

10. Do a select * on this table to show all the records

	SELECT * FROM visits;

11. Define a view that will list each dog and the number of visits they 
	have made.
	
	CREATE VIEW dog_visits AS SELECT dog_id, name, COUNT(*) 
	no_of_visits FROM dogs NATURAL JOIN visits GROUP by dog_id, 
	name;

12. Do a select * on this view to show all the records

	SELECT * FROM dog_visits;
